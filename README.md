    If you want to deploy your portfolio on a live website, you can use services like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel. Here's a brief guide on deploying your website with Netlify:

3. **Sign in to Netlify**: If you don't have an account, you can create one for free at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

4. **Site Setup**:
   - Click on "New site from Git" on your Netlify dashboard.
   - Connect your GitHub account.
   - Choose the repository you want to deploy (your portfolio repository).

5. **Deploy**:

6. **View Your Live Site**:
   - Once the site is deployed, you'll get a unique URL provided by Netlify. You can access your live portfolio through that link.
